      The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen 
      or even touched - they must be felt with the heart. Immature love 
      says: 'I love you because I need you.' Mature love 
      says 'I need you because I love you.'

    <h3 class="blue-gray">Love is Friendship. Friendship is Love â™¥</h3>
    <p class="justify">
      People may hear your words, but they feel your attitude. 
      Some people say I have attitude - maybe I do... but I think 
      you have to. You have to believe in yourself when no one else does - 
      that makes you a winner right there.
      Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving 
      someone deeply gives you courage. We waste time looking for the 
      perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
      There is nothing on this earth more to be prized than true friendship. 
      A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out. 
      Friends show their love in times of trouble, not in happiness. 
      One of the most beautiful qualities of true friendship is to understand 
      and to be understood.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
      Friends can help each other. A true friend is someone who lets you 
      have total freedom to be yourself - and especially to feel. Or, 
      not feel. Whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine 
      with them. That's what real love amounts to - 
      letting a person be what he really is.
    </p>
    <p class="justify">
      Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; 
      I may not follow. Just walk beside me and be my friend.
    </p>
    <h3 class="blue-gray">Unity is Strength...</h3>
    <p class="justify">
      Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; 
      working together is success. The real man smiles in trouble, 
      gathers strength from distress, and grows brave by reflection. 
      If you're not making mistakes, then you're not doing anything. 
      I'm positive that a doer makes mistakes. A journey of a thousand 
      miles begins with a single step.
    </p>
    <h3 class="blue-gray">A Little Learning is a Dangerous Thing...</h3>
    <p class="justify">
      When you know very little, you become arrogant and stubborn. 
      When you know something moderately well, you understand the 
      lacking and you always try to fill the gap in a cognitive process. 
      When you know something very good, you just become humble 
      and value everyone's opinion.
    </p>
    <img align="right" src="pic/blue-rose.gif" alt="Blue Rose">
    <h3 class="blue-gray">Passion</h3>
    <p class="justify">
      Do what you love to do and give it your very best. Whether it's 
      business or baseball, or the theater, or any field. If you don't love 
      what you're doing and you can't give it your best, get out of it. 
      Life is too short. You'll be an old man before you know it
